The Clinic Booking System is a simple relational database solution for managing clinic appointments, patients, doctors, and available time slots. The system allows users to:

1. Patients: Register and track patient details.

2. Doctors: Manage doctor information.

3. Appointments: Schedule and track appointments between patients and doctors.

4. TimeSlots: Manage available time slots for doctors.

The system enforces data integrity by using primary and foreign keys, ensuring that each patient, doctor, and appointment is linked correctly.
